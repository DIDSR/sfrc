sFRC for detecting hallucinations in medical image restoration 
========================================================================================================================
**sFRC** scans and performs Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC)-based analysis over small patches between images from AI-assisted methods and their reference counterparts to objectively and automatically identify hallucinations as detailed in our 
`sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_. You can also perform sFRC analysis to detect hallucinations from iterative regularization-based methods by simply comparing images from regularization-based vs. reference methods.

- **Hallucination Threshold**: The hallucination threshold can be directly input by users, or set using a few patches or ROIs that are predefined as hallucination by human observers or is determined using imaging theory-based limitation for a given undersampled image restoration problem [`Bhadra et al <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8673588/>`_, `sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_]. Using the known hallucinated patches, patch-wise FRC curves are obtained. Then the hallucination threshold is set as the maximum of the x-coordinate values corresponding to the set of x-coordinates due to the intersection between the FRC curves and the FRC thresholds.The FRC threshold is usually set the same for a given modality. In this work, we used y=0.5 and y=0.75 as the FRC thresholds for the CT superresolution and MRI subsampling problems respectively.

- **Outputs**: Small-sized red bounding boxes on input images that are deemed as hallucinated ROIs (in AI-assisted as well as reference images), and the total number of such ROIs detected as hallucination in the input images.
  These ROIs as red bounded box indicate that those regions have not been faithfully reconstructed. They may exhibit imaging errors that are readily non-discernible hallucinations to human eyes. Some of the 
  fakes/hallucination observed in our study include over-smoothing, in-homogeneity, tiny structural changes, removal of subtle features/signals, distortion of small organelles, addition of minute 
  indentation-/blood vessel-/plaque-like structures, coalescing of small organelles, unwarranted foldings, contrast migration anomaly etc. 
  
  A gif-based illustration on sFRC-based output – on SRGAN (left) and sharp-FBP (right) images  – using 20 image pairs from the sFRC paper for the CT super-resolution problem is provided above. 
  Movie files showing ROIs detected as hallucinations using sFRC for the entire CT test set is provided `here <https://fdahhs.ent.box.com/s/vvfcbqxd66a2x09yld1tyk2weqs72i7s>`_.

*Fig 3:  Red bounding boxes as outputs from sFRC. The bounding boxes on an AI-based and an inverse Fourier Transform (iFT)-based images indicate hallucinations detected by sFRC and corresponding reference anatomy. The AI-based image was restored from subsampled MRI data acquired using an acceleration factor of three (i.e., using only 33% of raw measurement data). The reference image was restored using physics-based inverse Fourier transform on the fully sampled data (i.e., using 100% of raw measurement data). A zoomed view of a pair of patches indicates removal of the dark signal in AI-based image as compared to its reference iFT patch.*

    sFRC analysis between image pairs from DL(or IRT)- & reference-based methods to detect hallucinations
    
    arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --input-folder        directory name containing images.
    --output-folder       output folder to save bounding box-based hallucinated labels on DL/IRT & reference image pairs, and sFRC plots.
    --patch-size          p96 or p64 or 48 or p32 to indicate patch sizes for the sFRC analysis. Change padding option in main.py for a
                          different patch size.
    --random_N            performs sfrc calculation on randomly selected 16 complimentary images from DL/IRT - Reference folders.
                          For more info refer to in-built options in main.py.
    --input-gen-folder    folder name containing DL or regularization method-based outputs.
    --target-gen-folder   folder name containing reference method-based outputs.
    --img-format          image format for input and target images. Dicom/raw/tif/png? To add a new image format read function look 
                          inside the function partition_read_n_sfrc_plot_n_calc in file mpi_utils.py.
    --multi-patients      if there are multiple-subfolders related to different patients.
    --remove-edge-padding remove patches at the edges of images when mod(img size, patch size) != 0.
    --apply-hann          apply hanning filter before the frc calculation.
    --frc-threshold       frc threshold to determine correlation cut-off between the 2 methods. This patch-based FRC analysis
                          is better suited with a constant threshold such as 0.5, 0.75. Other common options include half-bit, all,
                          one-bit. To add new threshold, look inside function FRC in the file frc_utils.py.
    --inscribed-rings     max frequency at which correlation is calculated is img (or patch) length/2. if false then frc will be
                          calculated upto the corner of the image (or patch).
    --anaRing             perimeter of circle-based calculation to determine data points in each ring. Otherwise, no. of pixels in
                          each ring used to determine data points in each ring.
    --rNx RNX             image x-size for raw image as input.
    --rNy RNY             image y-size for raw image as input. Default is same dim as rNx
    --in-dtype            data type of input images. It is needed for images with .raw filenames. It is also needed to set the maximum 
                          intensity value for air thresholding and windowing of patches when saving bounding box-based outputs.
    --save-patched-subplots
                          if you want to save patches with the bounding box and FRC plot results.
    --apply-bm3d          apply image-based mild bm3d smoothing before the frc calculation. It decreases the chance of quick FRC
                          drop. This means it increases the chance of missing hallucinations. But it has advantage of increasing PPV.
    --mtf-space           x-axis for FRC is in the mtf space. Uses the dx info. Use this option only if you have info on dx for your
                          acquisition. Otherwise, do not use this option. When this option is not used, x-axis for FRC has unit pixel(^-1).
    --dx                  xy plane pixel spacing. Default value is set from the LDGC dataset and has the unit mm.
    --ht                  patches whose x-coordinates (corresponding to the points when their FRC curves intersect with the frc-
                          threshold) that fall below this ht threshold will be labeled as hallucinated ROIs.
    --windowing           windowing used when generating the patched subplots Options include soft, lung, bone, unity and none.
                          Setting appropriate viewing window is very important in zeroing anomalies between a DL method- and
                          reference method-based outputs. For a sanity check, you may choose to confirm the marked ROIs generated
                          from this implementation by using software like ImageJ under different type of windowing.
    --remove-ref-noise    applies a gentle bilateral filtering to reference images.
    --img-y-padding       pads y-dim with zeros with pad_width=(rNx-rNy). It is useful when analyzing coronal-slices.

DEMO execution of sFRC
----------------------------------------------------------
The example codes below show how to run sfrc by using data from DL/IRT methods and their reference counterparts used in the `sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_. 
Run the codes below. Then accordingly change input paths and sfrc parameters for your application. 

1. sFRC on SRGAN-based CT upsampled (x4) images

   .. code-block::
      
      OUTPUT_FNAME="./results/CT/sm_srgan_tune_sh_L067/"
      INPUT_FOLDER="./ct_superresolution/results/test_sh_L067/ua_ll_smSRGAN_tune_in_x4/checkpoint-generator-20/"
      INPUT_GEN="test_sh_L067_cnn"
      TARGET_GEN="test_sh_L067_gt"
      mpirun --mca btl ^openib -np 1 python main.py --input-folder ${INPUT_FOLDER} --output-folder ${OUTPUT_FNAME} --patch-size 'p64'  --input-gen-folder ${INPUT_GEN} --target-gen-folder ${TARGET_GEN} --img-format 'raw' --frc-threshold '0.5' --in-dtype 'uint16' --anaRing --inscribed-rings --rNx 512 --apply-hann --mtf-space --ht 0.33 --windowing 'soft' --save-patched-subplots
   
   OR execute the demo bash file
   
   .. code-block:: 
      
      bash +x demo_sfrc_run.sh 'CT' 'tune' 'sh' 1

   'CT' indicates sFRC applied on CT-based data. 'sh' and 'tune' are options to indicate paths for sharp kernel-based data and 
   tuning set for sFRC parameters used in the `sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_. Likewise 'sm' indicates smooth kernel-based test set. 
   1 indicates one processing unit (-np) to be used in our mpi-based sFRC implementation. 
   Note that, in this git repo, the demo example for the CT application includes only 5 CT images. 
   As such, the no. of hallucinations, for the specified parameters, for sharp and smooth data will be 21 
   and 16 respectively. Refer to the next subsection to fetch the complete test set and results as 
   provided in the sFRC paper for the CT application. 

   Change the ht parameter as 0.25, 0.35, 0.34, and 0.33 to reproduce different sFRC-detected bounding boxes as hallucinations as shown in the supplemental part of the `sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_.

2. sFRC on UNet- and PLSTV-based MRI outputs from a subsampled acquisition (x3)

   .. code-block::
      
      bash +x demo_sfrc_run.sh 'MRI' 'test' 'unet' 4

   Change the third option to 'plstv' for the plstv-based results provided in the `sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_. 

Apply trained SRGAN 
--------------------
The SRGAN checkpoint provided in this repository was trained using CT images from the six patients provided in 
`LDGC dataset <https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=52758026>`_ and as detailed in the sFRC paper.
This checkpoint can be applied to the low-resolution CT images provided in this repository to upscale them by a factor of 4
in the following manner: 

3. Apply SRGAN on tuning set

   .. code-block:: 

      cd ct_superresolution
      bash +x demo_srgan_test.sh 'tune' 'sh' #on sharp kernel-based tuning set

To apply the SRGAN to all the CT images from patient L067 (as described in the sFRC paper) refer to "./ct_superresolution/create_sr_dataset/readme.txt".
Once you successfully download and preprocess smooth and sharp CT scans corresponding to patient L067, the following commands will 
yield hallucinated patches as tabulated in TABLE I in the `sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_ and as depicted in the following 
`movie files <https://fdahhs.ent.box.com/s/vvfcbqxd66a2x09yld1tyk2weqs72i7s>`_.

4. Get the mid-frequency image components corresponding to each CT tuning image to manually mark the hallucinated ROIs as shown in the supplemental part of the `sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_.

   .. code-block:: 

      python ct_superresolution/banded_plots_4r_sfrc_ct_tuning.py


5. Apply SRGAN on sFRC test set

   .. code-block:: 

      cd ct_superresolution
      bash +x demo_srgan_test.sh 'test' 'sh'
      bash +x demo_srgan_test.sh 'test' 'sm'

Then set the first command line input as 'test' to indicate tags related to the paths 
of CT images are test set for the sFRC analysis (as used in the `sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_) when executing demo_sfrc_run.sh.

6. sFRC on SRGAN-based CT upsampled (x4) test images (sharp as well as smooth)

   .. code-block:: 

      cd ..
      bash +x demo_sfrc_run.sh 'CT' 'test' 'sh' 47 # on sharp test data with 47 set as no. of processors
      bash +x demo_sfrc_run.sh 'CT' 'test' 'sm' 47 #on smooth test data with 47 set as the no. of processors

Apply trained UNet 
-------------------
The trained Unet model and data provided in this repository (as well as used in the `sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_) have been imported from the following github
repository: `hallucinations-tomo-recon <https://github.com/comp-imaging-sci/hallucinations-tomo-recon>`_. Also, 
`Pediatric epilepsy resection MRI dataset <https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Pediatric_epilepsy_resection_MRI_dataset/9856205>`_ is 
the original source of the MRI data. 

7. Apply Unet on MRI test set

   .. code-block:: 
   
      cd mr_subsampling/unet
      bash +x run_unet_test.sh
      cd ..

PLSTV-based reconstruction 
-------------------------------
Follow the installation instructions provided in the `BART repository <https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/>`_.
Then edit the path to BART's python wrapper in line 20 in file "./mr_subsampling/plstv/bart_pls_tv.py".

8. Apply PLSTV on MRI test set

   .. code-block:: 

      cd plstv
      bash +x run_bart_pls_tv.sh

Conventional artifacts (non-hallucinatory) 
--------------------------------------------

9. Refer to the readme file inside the folder conventional_artifact to simulate the four different artifacts (missing wedge, distortion, blur, noise) discussed in the supplemental part of the `sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_. Update folder conventional_artifact/data per the options you used to simulate the artifacts or per your own experimental data. 

10. Below is the demo run of the sFRC on the conventional artifacts shown in the supplemental part of the `sFRC paper <https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.171259560.02243347/v2>`_.

   .. code-block:: 

      bash +x demo_sfrc_on_artifacts.sh 'missing_wedge' 1

   Change the first option to 'blur' or 'noise' or 'distortion' for the sFRC result on the other forms of conventional artifacts.
